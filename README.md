# Library-Book-Management

A project that applies **OOP, classes/objects, inheritance, iterators, polymorphism, and scope** in Python.  
It models a small library system with books and extended textbook details.

## Features
- `Book` class for common book details.  
- `TextBook` subclass with extra attributes.  
- Iterator to loop through stored books.  
- Polymorphism: same method behaves differently for `Book` and `TextBook`.  
- Global variable used to demonstrate Python scope.
